Most of the time it’s obvious when a keyword doesn’t relate to your product or service, but then other times not so much. Especially when you’re not sure what the search term means exactly.</p><p>When this happens, the best thing to do is to search the term in question in Google and see what pages Google thinks is relevant to the search term. If the pages that rank on the top are irrelevant to your product or service, then it’s a safe bet including it as a negative keyword on your campaign because the majority of the people searching this term are not going to be interested in what you have to offer.</p><p>If, on the other hand, the pages that rank on the top are relevant to your offering, not only should you NOT add it as a negative keyword but you should consider creating a new ad group around that new keyword to test out using ads that include that search term in the ad copy.</p><p>Now don’t just sit there, go and implement this strategy and let me know if it lowers your cost per conversion/sale.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[I enabled SSL but when I type in my URL it still shows only HTTP]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I had a client recently tell me that they bought an SSL certificate and that their site was now secure.</p><p>I of course, went and typed in ‘theirdomain.com’ to see if this was true, and sure enough it showed the site as being unsecure still with ‘http’ in the</p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/forced-ssl-https/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5f925f2b899777577da35522</guid><category><![CDATA[SSL]]></category><category><![CDATA[HTTPS]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Steve Longoria]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had a client recently tell me that they bought an SSL certificate and that their site was now secure.</p><p>I of course, went and typed in ‘theirdomain.com’ to see if this was true, and sure enough it showed the site as being unsecure still with ‘http’ in the address bar.</p><p>They did indeed have an SSL certificate activated on their domain but the problem here is that they didn’t have ‘Forced SSL’ implemented.</p><p>Forced SSL is when your site goes to the secure version (HTTPS) of your site no matter if the visitor types:<br><a href="http://www.yourdomain.com/" rel="noopener">www.yourdomain.com</a><br>yourdomain.com<br><a href="http://yourdomain.com/" rel="noopener">http://yourdomain.com</a><br><a href="http://www.yourdomain.com/" rel="noopener">http://www.yourdomain.com</a>.</p><p>Basically, it doesn’t matter how the visitor types in your domain (so long as it’s spelled correctly and has the correct top-level domain) they’ll reach the secure (HTTPS) version of your site.</p><p>The easiest way to achieve this is to use <a href="https://blog.stevelongoria.net/2018/07/30/forced-ssl/cloudflare.com">Cloudflare.com</a>.</p><p>Cloudflare offer’s a free SSL with their free membership level.</p><p>Once you switch your DNS over to Cloudflare by following the simple instructions after joining, you’ll simply need to setup a “Page Rule” inside Cloudflare to enable Forced SSL.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.stevelongoria.net/2018/07/30/forced-ssl/forcedsslcloudflare.png" class="kg-image" alt title="Cloudflare Page Rule"></figure><p>It’s as simple as inserting ‘http://<em><em>yourdomain.com/</em></em>‘ under the “URL matches” section of the Page Rule creation process and “Always use HTTPS” under the last section of the Page Rule creation process as shown in the image above.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Easiest Way To Integrate Drip Into Your Ghost Blog]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><strong><strong>Note: If you’re looking to put a contact form on your Ghost blog, you actually want to <a href="https://blog.stevelongoria.net/2019/03/10/how-to-setup-a-ghost-blog-contact-form/">read this blog post</a>!</strong></strong></p><p><a href="https://ghost.org/" rel="noopener">Ghost</a> blogs have a built in subscription feature which allows people to optin to your newsletter.

You can of course sync with a bunch of marketing automation and email marketing software like Drip by using their Zapier integration, but that’s added cost where it’s just not needed.</p><p>What I’m going to show you in this post is how to integrate Drip into your Ghost Blog so you don’t have to pay for zaps via Zapier integration.</p><p>The easiest route for most is going to be simply using the Drip Form Widget and install it site wide on your Ghost Blog.</p><p>You can find the javascript snippet after inside your Drip dashboard under Account &gt; Site Setup:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.stevelongoria.net/2018/07/28/drip-ghost-blog/dripjssnippet.png" class="kg-image" alt title="Drip JavaScript Snippet"></figure><p>We’re going to inject this code into our Ghost blog by using the ‘code injection’ feature under Settings inside your Ghost dashboard:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.stevelongoria.net/2018/07/28/drip-ghost-blog/ghostcodeinject.png" class="kg-image" alt title="Ghost Code Injection"></figure><p>Now all you have to do is <a href="https://help.drip.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003730671-Create-a-Form" rel="noopener">create a new Drip Form Widget</a> inside your Drip dashboard. You can control exactly which pages the widget shows up on, how often it shows up, etc.</p><h2 id="but-i-hate-pop-ups-steve-i-don-t-want-a-pop-up-"><strong><strong>But I Hate Pop-ups Steve, I Don’t Want A Pop-up!</strong></strong></h2><p>I hear ya, I’m not a big fan of pops either. I prefer having my optin forms embedded into my pages or as a pop-up modal that is only triggered when the user clicks a button or link. You can actually do the pop-up modal using the Drip Form Widget but I found it to be inconsistent, it would pop-up most of the time when the button was clicked but not other times.</p><p>I decided to just create my own custom styled optin form embedded in the page. You can read about how I set that up <a href="https://blog.stevelongoria.net/2019/01/17/custom-drip-optin-form-ghost-blog-theme/">here in this post</a>.</p><p><strong><strong>Drip Hosted Form</strong></strong></p><p>Before I setup the custom optin form and embedded it in the page, I simply hardcoded some links in the Ghost Theme to point a Drip form that was hosted by Drip. You can see an example of the Drip hosted optin form <a href="https://www.getdrip.com/forms/849303961/submissions/new?" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>Here are the files and code I changed in order to get my homepage newsletter sign up button and “Subscribe” nav link to point to the Drip hosted form (click on the images to view the code change in Github):</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.stevelongoria.net/2018/07/28/drip-ghost-blog/indexnavghost.png" class="kg-image" alt title="Ghost Index &amp; Nav Changes"></figure><p>Here’s the code I changed on the post.hbs template so the newsletter sign-up call to action shows up at the bottom of each blog post:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.stevelongoria.net/2018/07/28/drip-ghost-blog/ghostposttemplate.png" class="kg-image" alt title="Ghost Post Template"></figure><p>And that’s it, those are all of the top ways to integrate Drip into your Ghost blog.

In fact, you don’t even need a database in order to have a blog these days. This comes with a lot of advantages, performance and security being among the top.</p><p>When I decided I was going to start blogging again and created a blog about coding, I knew I didn’t want to use Wordpress. I’d been learning JavaScript and Node over the past year and so I knew I wanted to keep it in this realm.</p><p>That’s when I decided to go with <a href="https://blog.stevelongoria.net/2018/07/23/tired-of-wordpress/Ghost.org">Ghost</a>. Ghost is a great, simple solution that I’ve been super happy with. It makes publishing super easy and quite pleasurable.</p><p>The downside is that Ghost Pro is kind of costly at $29/mo. It comes with a dedicated IP though so it’s really good hosting. It’s hard to feel bad though when the money goes to supporting the Ghost open source project.</p><p>Another downside is that Ghost uses a database which means that, while it’s faster than Wordpress, it’s not the fastest blog solution available.</p><p>When I started developing my business and marketing blog at <a href="https://blog.stevelongoria.net/2018/07/23/tired-of-wordpress/stevelongoria.net">SteveLongoria.net</a> (the very blog you happen to be reading) I thought I’d give <a href="https://hexo.io/" rel="noopener">Hexo Static Site Generator</a> a shot for my blog.</p><p>Right off the bat, if you’re not comfortable with the command line/terminal on your computer, you’re probably not going to want to use Hexo. It requires some programming knowledge, especially compared to Ghost which is actually easier than Wordpress to get started.</p><p>With that said, Hexo comes with some remarkable benefits:</p><ol><li>There’s no database so your blog is completely static. This of course means you can easily expect page load speeds under a second. This of course is important considering most people expect your site to load under 3 seconds and page speed is a huge factor in terms of SEO.</li><li>You can publish your Hexo blog for free using <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" rel="noopener">Netlify</a>, including custom domain name.</li></ol><p>This is great especially for those who are on a budget. You don’t have to upgrade your servers until your website is already generating traction.</p><p>To get started ASAP with Hexo and Netlify, follow this <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/26/a-step-by-step-guide-hexo-on-netlify/" rel="noopener">free guide here</a> and also checkout <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOMJR6D25ishrSedvsguVSm" rel="noopener">this free video tutorial series</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
